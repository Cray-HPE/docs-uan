      <description>Troubleshoot UAN Disk Configuration Issues Perform this procedure to enable uan_disk_config to run successfully by erasing existing disk partitions. UAN disk configuration will fail if the disk on the node is already partitioned. Manually erase any existing partitions to fix the issue.
This procedure currently only addresses uan_disk_config errors due to existing disk partitions.
Refer to About UAN Configuration for an explanation of UAN disk configuration.
The most common cause of failure in the uan_disk_config role is the disk having been previously configured without a /scratch and /swap partition.</description>

      <description>About UAN Configuration This section describes the Ansible playbooks and roles that configure UANs.
UAN configuration overview Configuration of UAN nodes is performed by the Configuration Framework Service (CFS). CFS can apply configuration to both images and nodes. When the configuration is applied to nodes, the nodes must be booted and accessible through SSH over the Node Management Network (NMN).
The Ansible roles involved in UAN configuration are listed in the site.</description>
