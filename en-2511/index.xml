      <description>About UAN Configuration This section describes the Ansible playbooks and roles that configure UANs.
UAN configuration overview Configuration of UAN nodes is performed by the Configuration Framework Service (CFS). CFS can apply configuration to both images and nodes. When the configuration is applied to nodes, the nodes must be booted and accessible through SSH over the Node Management Network (NMN).
The Ansible roles involved in UAN configuration are listed in the site.</description>

To reach the vulnerability, kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege. There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. When CONFIG_TLS is enabled, users can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket.</description>
