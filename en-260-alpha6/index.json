	"content": "Notable Changes The following guide describes changes included in a particular UAN version that may be of note during an install or upgrade.\nWhen an upgrade is being performed, please review the notable changes for all of the UAN versions up to the version being installed. If a particular version does not appear in this guide, it may have only had minor changes. For a full account of the changes involved in a release, consult the ChangeLog.md file at the root of the UAN product repository.\nUAN 2.2 UAN 2.2 was an internal release and was not made generally available. UAN 2.3.1 UAN 2.3 no longer ships a default recipe or image. To build a UAN image, administrators should select a COS recipe to build as the base of their UAN and Application Nodes. The role uan_packages will now install the rpms needed by UAN and Application Nodes The role uan_packages supports GPG checking when the CSM version is 1.2 or greater. uan_disable_gpg_check: yes must be set if CSM is earlier than 1.2 uan_disable_gpg_check: no should be set if CSM is 1.2 or greater UAN 2.4.0 UAN 2.4.0 adds support for a Bifurcated Customer Access Network (BiCAN) and the ability to specify a default route other than the CAN or CHN when they are selected. Application nodes may now choose to implement user access over either the existing Customer Access Network (CAN), the new Customer High Speed Network (CHN), or a direct connection to the customers user network. By default, a direct connection is selected as it was in previous releases. uan_can_setup, when set to yes, selects the customer access network implementation based on the setting of the BICAN System Default Route in SLS. Application nodes may now set a default route other than the CAN or CHN default route when uan_can_setup: yes. uan_customer_default_route: true will allow a customer defined default route to be set using the customer_uan_routes structure when uan_can_setup is set to yes. sat bootprep is now used in the documentation to streamline the IMS, CFS, and BOS commands to create and customize images and creating sessiontemplates. UAN 2.4.1 The UAN CFS playbook now supports a section for Compute nodes. The Compute section will run the role uan_interfaces to provide Customer High Speeed Network (CHN) routing. CHN on the Compute nodes requires: Customer High Speed Network has been enabled in CSM. See \u0026ldquo;Enabling Customer High Speed Network Routing\u0026rdquo; in the CSM Documentation UAN CFS configurd with uan_can_setup: yes Fully configured HSN SLS has IP assignments for compute nodes on hsn0 Updates to GPU roles to match COS 2.3 UAN 2.4.2 There is a known issue with the version of GPU support included in the UAN CFS repo. The result is that both AMD and Nvidia SDKs are not able to be projected at the same time. Until this is resolved in a later release, modify the site.yml in the UAN CFS repo to only include either amd or nvidia. UAN 2.4.3 A new CFS role, uan_hardening adds iptables rules that will block SSH traffic to NCNs. See the README.md in the uan_hardening role for more information. UAN 2.5.3 A technical preview of a standard SLES image for UAN/Application nodes is included. Support SLES15SP4 COS based images UAN 2.6.0 UAN CFS configurations now require a CSM and two COS layers. Roles that were duplicated from COS CFS in the UAN CFS repo have been removed. Values for COS CFS roles that were previously set in the UAN CFS group_vars directory should now be set in COS CFS group_vars UAN CFS has been restructured to work for COS and Standard SLES images uan_packages variables are now vars/uan_packages.yml and vars/uan_repos.yml and have been renamed. Admins will need to migrate to the new settings. The NMN connection now supports bonding (optional). The default is a non-bonded single interface. "

	"content": "Test Plan for User Access Node (UAN) and Repurposed Compute Node as UAN The following is the test plan for the User Access Node (UAN) or a Compute Node that has been repurposed to function as a UAN. The tests are grouped in three categories:\nUnit tests Integration tests Functional tests Unit Tests When possible, unit tests are run when the various components of UAN are built (uan-rpms, uan, and uan-product-stream). The uan repository contains the ansible code used when UANs boot and configure and much of the testing for that compoment must occur on a fully configured system. Future enhancements are underway to test the various compoments of UAN on a Virtual Shasta enviroment in GCP.\nSummary Description Automated Notes uan builds Verify the uan repo is able to generate artifacts yes Run make in a local checkout uan-rpms builds Verify the uan-rpms repo is able to generate rpms yes Run make in a local checkout uan-product-stream builds Verify the uan-product-stream repo is able to generate a release yes Tag a new release in uan-product-stream or run make in a local checkout Integration Tests The following integration tests verify that the UAN software interacts correctly with the rest of the products. The result of the integration tests will be a fully built and customized UAN image that boots and configures correctly. Depending on the configuration of the test system, extra integrations tests may be performed (HSN booting, WLM configuration, GPU configuration, etc).\nSummary Description Automated Notes Install the UAN product Run the install procedure Yes Run install.sh from Install_the_UAN_Product_Stream.md Build a COS recipe for UAN Verify the COS recipe can be built as the base for a UAN image no Build_a_New_UAN_Image_Using_the_COS_Recipe.md Run UAN CFS Verify the CFS layers run correctly (SHS, UAN, WLM, CPE, etc) no Create_UAN_Boot_Images.md Boot UANs Verify the UAN boots successfully no Boot_UANS.md Enable HSN booting Verify the UAN is able to HSN boot no Consult COS documentation Enable GPU Verify the UAN is able to configure GPUs no Consult GPU documentation Functional Tests With a fully configured Shasta system, the following functional tests determines that a UAN is able to perform its intended capabilities. These tests apply to both native UANs and Compute Nodes which have been repurposed as UANs.\nSummary Description Automated Notes User Authentication Verify a user is able to ssh to the UAN using LDAP authentication. no ssh user@uan Job launch Verify a user is able to submit a basic job. no srun hostname Verify CPE Verify the Cray Programming Environment is available no module list Verify GPU functionality Run the test suite if GPUs are configured yes /opt/cray/uan/tests/validate-gpu.sh \u0026lt;nvidia|amd\u0026gt; Verify CAN or CHN Configuration Inspect the network interfaces and default routes used for CAN or CHN no For systems running CAN, there must be a can0 interface present and the default route should be over that device.For systems running CHN (including Compute Nodes repurposed as UANs), the hsn0 interface must have a CHN IP in addition to the HSN IP and the default route should be over the hsn0 device.

When true, the NMN network connection will be configured as a bonded pair of interfaces defined by the members of the uan_nmn_bond_slaves variable. The bonded NMN interface is named nmnb0. When false, the NMN network connection will be configured as a single interface named nmn0.\nThe default value of uan_nmn_bond is no.\nuan_nmn_bond: no uan_nmn_bond_slaves\nuan_nmn_bond_slaves is a list of the interfaces to use as the bond slave pair when uan_nmn_bond is true.\nThe interface names must be in a format which doesn\u0026rsquo;t change between reboots of the node, such as ens10f0 which is the first port of the NIC in slot 10.\nNOTE: ens10f0 is typically the first port of the OCP 25Gb card that the node PXE boots.\nIMPORTANT! The first interface in the list must be the nmn0 interface which is configured during the initial image boot, typically ens10f0. This is required because the MAC address of the nmn0 interface is the MAC associated with the IP address of the UAN. The bonded nmnb0 interface and the bond slaves will assume this MAC and the IP address of nmn0 to preserve connectivity.\nThe second interface is typically the first port of a different 25Gb NIC for resiliency.\nThe default values of uan_nmn_bond_slaves are shown here. They may need to be changed to match the actual node cabling and NIC configuration.\nuan_nmn_bond_slaves: - \u0026#34;ens10f0\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;ens1f0\u0026#34; uan_can_setup\nBoolean variable controlling the configuration of user access to UAN nodes. When true, user access is configured over either the Customer Access Network (CAN) or Customer High Speed Network (CHN), depending on which is configured on the system.\nWhen uan_can_setup is false, user access over the CAN or CHN is not configured on the UAN nodes and no default route is configured. The Admin must then specify the default route in customer_uan_routes.\nThe default value of uan_can_setup is no.\nuan_can_setup: no uan_can_bond_slaves\nuan_can_bond_slaves is a list of the interfaces to use as the bond slave pair when uan_can_setup is true, uan_nmn_bond is true, and the Customer Access Network (CAN) is configured on the system. This variable is ignored if uan_nmn_bond is false.\nThe interface names must be in a format which doesn\u0026rsquo;t change between reboots of the node, such as ens10f1 which is the second port of the NIC in slot 10.\nNOTE: ens10f1 is typically the second port of the OCP 25Gb card and is used as one of the bond slaves in the CAN bond0 interface.\nThe second interface is typically the second port of a different 25Gb NIC for resiliency.\nThe default values of uan_can_bond_slaves are shown here. They may need to be changed to match the actual node cabling and NIC configuration.\nuan_can_bond_slaves: - \u0026#34;ens10f1\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;ens1f1\u0026#34; uan_customer_default_route\nBoolean variable that allows the default route to be set by the customer_uan_routes data when uan_can_setup is true.\nBy default, no default route is setup unless uan_can_setup is true, which sets the default route to the CAN or CHN.\nuan_customer_default_route: no sls_nmn_name\nNode Management Network name used by SLS. This value should not be changed.\nsls_nmn_name: \u0026#34;NMN\u0026#34; sls_nmn_svcs_name\nNode Management Services Network name used by SLS.

	"content": "Install or Upgrade UAN Install and Upgrade Framework The Install and Upgrade Framework (IUF) provides commands which install, upgrade and deploy products on systems managed by CSM. IUF capabilities are described in detail in the IUF section of the Cray System Management Documentation. The initial install and upgrade workflows described in the HPE Cray EX System Software Stack Installation and Upgrade Guide for CSM (S-8052) detail when and how to use IUF with a new release of UAN or any other HPE Cray EX product.\nThis document does not replicate install, upgrade or deployment procedures detailed in the IUF section of the Cray System Management Documentation. This document provides details regarding software and configuration content specific to UAN which may be needed when installing, upgrading or deploying a UAN release. The IUF section of the Cray System Management Documentation will indicate when sections of this document should be referred to for detailed information.\nIUF will perform the following tasks for a release of UAN.\nIUF deliver-product stage: Uploads UAN configuration content to VCS Uploads UAN information to the CSM product catalog Uploads UAN content to Nexus repositories Uploads the UAN Stock Kernel image to IMS IUF update-vcs-config stage: Updates the VCS integration branch with new UAN configuration content IUF update-cfs-config stage: Creates new CFS configurations with new UAN configuration content IUF prepare-images stage: Creates updated UAN images based on COS with new UAN content IUF managed-nodes-rollout stage: Boots UAN nodes with an image containing new UAN content IUF uses a variety of CSM and SAT tools when performing these tasks. The IUF section of the Cray System Management Documentation describes how to use these tools directly if it is desirable to use them instead of IUF.\nIUF Stage Details for UAN This section describes any UAN details that an administrator may need to be aware of before executing IUF stages. Entries are prefixed with Information if no administrative action is required or Action if an administrator may need to perform tasks outside of IUF.\nupdate-vcs-config Action: Before executing this stage, the administrator should ensure the IUF site variables file (see iuf -sv SITE_VARS) is updated to reflect site preferences, including the desired VCS branching configuration. The branching configuration will be used by the update-vcs-config stage when modifying UAN branches in VCS.\nupdate-cfs-config Action: Before executing this stage, any site-local UAN configuration changes should be made so the following stages execute using the desired UAN configuration values. See the About UAN Configuration section of this documentation for UAN configuration content details. Note that the Prepare for UAN Product Installation section is required for fresh install scenarios.\nUAN Content Installed The following subsections describe the majority of the UAN content installed and configured on the system by IUF. The new version of UAN (2.6.XX) and its artifacts will be displayed in the CSM product catalog alongside any previously released version of UAN and its artifacts.\nConfiguration UAN provides configuration content in the form of Ansible roles and plays. This content is uploaded to a VCS repository in a branch with a specific UAN version number (2.6.XX) to distinguish it from any previously released UAN configuration content. This content is described in detail in the About UAN Configuration section.\nFor application nodes based on COS, the COS compute image is used as the base application node image and two COS CFS layers are required. The first COS CFS layer runs the cos-application.yml Ansible playbook and ensures that the COS content is applied as part of the image customization and node personalization processes. This COS CFS layer must precede the UAN CFS layer in the UAN CFS configuration. A second COS CFS layer running the Ansible playbook, cos-application-after.yml, runs after the UAN CFS layer of the UAN CFS configuration to ensure that the application node initrd is rebuilt and that any customer defined filesystems are configured.\nInput files for sat bootprep are provided in the hpc-csm-software-recipe VCS repository and include COS components in the CFS configuration, node image, and BOS session template definitions. The compute-and-uan-bootprep.yaml input file is used for compute and application nodes.\nProcedure to Set Root Password For UAN/Application Nodes The following instructions describe how to set the root password for UAN/Application nodes.\nObtain the HashiCorp Vault root token.\nncn-m001# kubectl get secrets -n vault cray-vault-unseal-keys \\ -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.data.vault-root}\u0026#39; | base64 -d; echo Log into the HashiCorp Vault pod.\nncn-m001# kubectl exec -itn vault cray-vault-0 -c vault -- sh Once attached to the pod\u0026rsquo;s shell, log into vault and read the secret/uan key by executing the following commands. If the secret is empty, \u0026ldquo;No value found at secret/uan\u0026rdquo; will be displayed.\npod# export VAULT_ADDR=http://cray-vault:8200 pod# vault login pod# vault read secret/uan If no value is found for this key, complete the following steps in another shell on the NCN management node.\na. Generate the password HASH for the root user. Replace \u0026lsquo;PASSWORD\u0026rsquo; with a chosen root password.\n```bash ncn-m001# openssl passwd -6 -salt $(\u0026lt; /dev/urandom tr -dc A-Z-a-z-0-9 | head -c4) PASSWORD ``` b. Take the HASH value returned from the previous command and enter the following in the vault pod\u0026rsquo;s shell. Instead of HASH, use the value returned from the previous step. You must escape the HASH value with the single quote to preserve any special characters that are part of the HASH value. If you previously have exited the pod, repeat steps 1-3 above; there is no need to perform the vault read since the content is empty.\n```bash pod# vault write secret/uan root_password='HASH' ``` c. Verify the new hash value is stored.\n```bash pod# vault read secret/uan ... pod# exit ``` UAN Stock Kernel Image UAN provides a stock kernel Application Node image which may be used on Application nodes that do not require any COS compatibility as UAN does. This image is not based on the COS image which the default UAN image is and is uploaded to IMS as part of the installation process. The stock kernel Application Node image is based on SLES 15 SP4.\nRPMs UAN provides RPMs used on UAN nodes. The RPMs are uploaded to Nexus as part of the installation process.\nThe following Nexus raw repositories are created:\nuan-2.6.XX-sle-15sp4 uan-2.6.XX-sle-15sp3 The following Nexus group repositories are created and reference the aforementioned Nexus raw repos.\nuan-2.6-sle-15sp4 uan-2.6-sle-15sp3 The uan-2.6-sle-15sp4 and uan-2.6-sle-15sp3 Nexus group repositories are used when building UAN node images and are accessible on UAN nodes after boot.\n"

Future releases will streamline these manual configuration steps and enhance the experience of using the rootless podman containers. Therefore, some of these configuration options may change in future releases.\nUAI Experience on UANs In UAN 2.6, a new playbook has been added to create a single node, K3s cluster. This K3s environment can then run the services necessary to replicate the experience of User Access Instances (UAIs) on one or more UANs.\nUse of K3s K3s will serve as the orchestrator of services necessary to replicate the capabilities of UAIs on UAN hardware. This includes HAProxy, MetalLB, and eventually DNS services like ExternalDNS and PowerDNS. Notably, this does not orchestrate instances of sshd and podman containers through K3s. K3s and the initial set of services mimic how the \u0026ldquo;Broker UAIs\u0026rdquo; in CSM to handle the SSH ingress and redirection of users into their interactive environment.\nUse of Podman Traditional UAIs in CSM required some level of privilege in CSM for access to host volume mounts, networking, and startup activities. Podman containers offer an attractive solution for an interactive environment in which to place users. They can be rootless containers that do not rely on privilege escalation. When running on UANs, podman containers have access to a hosting environment that is already tailored to users.\nOverview The overall component flow for replicating containerized environments for End-Users on UANs is as follows:\nA user uses ssh to initiate a connection to the HAProxy load-balancer running in K3s. HAProxy, using the configured load balancing algorithms, will forward the SSH connection to an instance of sshd running on a UAN. sshd, running on a UAN via systemd, will initiate a rootless podman container as the user using the ForceCommand configuration. The user is placed in a podman container for an interactive session, or their SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND is run in the container. When the user disconnects, the podman process exits, and the container is removed. There are alternate configurations of podman that would allow for different workflows, for example, the main pid of the container could be long running, to facilitate easier reentry to the container on subsequent logins.\nPrerequisites The following steps should be completed prior to configuring the UAN with K3s.\nDesignate a UAN to operate as the K3s control-plane node.\nNote: In a future release, additional UANs will be able to join as extra manager or worker nodes.\nIdentify a pool of IP addresses for the services running in K3s.\nThis address pool must be routable from the UAN control-plane, and should be unused for other purposes.\nThis will allow for external LoadBalancer IP Address to be assigned to services like HAProxy. Initially, these IP addresses will serve as the SSH ingress for instances of HAProxy.\nConfigure and create the /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid files.\nTo allow for users to run rootless podman containers, these files must be present and configured with an entry for each user. These files should be uploaded to the user S3 bucket:\n$ cray artifacts list user --format json { \u0026#34;artifacts\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;subuid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;LastModified\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2023-02-21T23:41:43.948000+00:00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ETag\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;c543aebb9b40bcf48879885734447090\\\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Size\u0026#34;: 145686, \u0026#34;StorageClass\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;STANDARD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Owner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;DisplayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;User Service User\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;USER\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;Key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;subgid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;LastModified\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2023-02-21T23:41:43.948000+00:00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ETag\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;73032ede132e44d2c1bc567246901737\\\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Size\u0026#34;: 145686, \u0026#34;StorageClass\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;STANDARD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Owner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;DisplayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;User Service User\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;USER\u0026#34; } } ] } Podman Image Place a container image suitable for users within a container image registry accessible from the UAN. Configuring with Configuration Framework Service (CFS) After completing the Prerequisites section, the following are available to proceed with configuring a UAN to run K3s.\nA fully configured UAN An IPAddress start and end range to assign to MetalLB Prepared subuid and subgid files Configuration Files and Playbook Configuration for K3s and related services are controlled in the following ansible files in the UAN VCS repository:\n$ ls uan-config-management/vars/ | egrep \u0026#34;k3s|sshd|helm\u0026#34; uan_helm.yml uan_k3s.yml uan_sshd.yml The ansible playbook to install and configure K3s may be found here:\n$ ls uan-config-management | grep k3s k3s.yml Ansible Roles The following Ansible roles are provided in the uan-config-management repository in VCS. There are README.md files in each Ansible role directory in this repository that provide further details.\nuan-k3s-install: Download and stage K3s assets necessary to initialize and configure k3s on a node uan-k3s-stage: Install and configure K3s on a node uan-helm: Perform tasks to initialize an environment to install helm charts uan-haproxy: Deploy a list of HAProxy charts to the k3s cluster uan-metallb: Deploy the MetalLB chart to the k3s cluster uan-sshd: Create and enable instances of sshd with systemd Artifactory Assets UAN uploads artifacts to deploy to the UAN control-plane node in a new nexus repository:\nuan-2.6.XX-third-party The following Nexus group repository is created and reference the aforementioned UAN Nexus raw repos.\nuan-2.6-third-party This repository will contain the installer for K3s, Helm charts for HAProxy and MetalLB, etc.\nValidation Tests To validate the K3s cluster once deployed, see the Validation Checks section of this document for details.\nConfiguring K3s, MetalLB, HAProxy, and SSHD for use with Podman Each of the sections below describe how the various comonents deployed to K3s and the UANs may be configured to enable users to SSH to rootless podman containers. As there is no one configuration to fit any one use case, read and understand each section to modify the configuration as needed. Once each section has been completed, see Deploy K3s to the UAN.\nMetalLB Configure the start and end range for MetalLB IPAddressPool in vars/uan_helm.yml:\n$ grep \u0026#34;^metallb_ipaddresspool\u0026#34; vars/uan_helm.yml metallb_ipaddresspool_range_start: \u0026#34;x.x.x.x\u0026#34; metallb_ipaddresspool_range_end: \u0026#34;x.x.x.x\u0026#34; MetalLB will assign an IP address to each service running in K3s that requires and external IP address. In the case of HAProxy, each instance of HAProxy will require an IP address. Podman containers do not require their own IP address.\nNote: In a future version of CSM, this range may be integrated into the System Layout Service (SLS) so the range will be automatically determined.\nImportant: Before modifying customer-access, be sure to verify none of the IP Addresses in the new pool for UANs are being used by IMS or UAIs:\n# kubectl get services -n ims | grep ims # kubectl get services -n user | grep uai # kubectl get services -n uai | grep It may be possible to reallocate the CSM MetalLB pool customer-access from CSM to make room for a subset of IPs to use with MetalLB on UANs. To shrink the customer-access pool in CSM, edit the configmap and pick a new CIDR block for for customer-access. In this example the CIDR block was x.x.x.x/26:\n# kubectl edit -n metallb-system cm/metallb ... data: config: | address-pools: - addresses: - x.x.x.x/27 name: customer-access protocol: bgp ... This leaves a portion of IP Address unallocated that may then be used to set metallb_ipaddresspool_range_start and metallb_ipaddresspool_end.\nImportant: When calculating the range of IP Address now available from customer-access. Be sure to account for the Broadcast IP of the remaining customer-access pool.\nTo complete migrating the IP Address range out of CSM, restart the MetalLB controller pod in CSM.\n# kubectl delete pod -n metallb-system -l app.kubernetes.io/component=controller HAProxy Configuration Each SSH ingress is backed by a K3s deployment of HAProxy. By default, a single instance of HAProxy is enabled in vars/uan_helm.yml:\nuan_haproxy: - name: \u0026#34;haproxy-uai\u0026#34; namespace: \u0026#34;haproxy-uai\u0026#34; chart: \u0026#34;{{ haproxy_chart }}\u0026#34; chart_path: \u0026#34;{{ helm_install_path }}/charts/{{ haproxy_chart }}.tgz\u0026#34; args: \u0026#34;--set service.type=LoadBalancer\u0026#34; This must be further configured with additional values to populate the HAProxy configuration. For example, to load-balance SSH to three UANs, the following configuration changes should be made:\nuan_haproxy: - name: \u0026#34;haproxy-uai\u0026#34; namespace: \u0026#34;haproxy-uai\u0026#34; chart: \u0026#34;{{ haproxy_chart }}\u0026#34; chart_path: \u0026#34;{{ helm_install_path }}/charts/{{ haproxy_chart }}.tgz\u0026#34; args: \u0026#34;--set service.type=LoadBalancer\u0026#34; config: | global log stdout format raw local0 maxconn 1024 defaults log global mode tcp timeout connect 10s timeout client 36h timeout server 36h option dontlognull listen ssh bind *:22 balance leastconn mode tcp option tcp-check tcp-check expect rstring SSH-2.0-OpenSSH.* server uan01 uan01.example.domain.com:9000 check inter 10s fall 2 rise 1 server uan02 uan02.example.domain.com:9000 check inter 10s fall 2 rise 1 server uan03 uan03.example.domain.com:9000 check inter 10s fall 2 rise 1 This is an example that should be tailored to the desired configuration. See the SSHD Configuration section to create new instances of SSHD to respond to HAProxy connections outside of the standard SSHD running on port 22.\nFor more information HAProxy configurations, see HAProxy Configuration.\nTo enable additional instances of HAProxy representing alternate configurations, add a new element to the list uan_haproxy.\nSSHD Configuration The role uan_sshd runs in the playbook k3s.yml to start and configure new instances of SSHD to respond to HAProxy forwarded connections.

This is typically done when the processor type of the compute node is not yet available in a UAN server.\nOverview The following steps outline the process of repurposing a compute node to be used as a UAN.\nVerify the System Default Route is set to CHN.\nChange the role of the compute node in the Hardware State Manager from Compute to Application and set the sub-role to UAN.\nEnsure that IPs on the CHN exist for the computes nodes in SLS.\nBoot the repurposed compute node as a UAN.\nVerify the repurposed compute node functions as a UAN.\nPrerequisites There are no changes needed in hardware, network cabling, or UEFI/BIOS/BMC configuration to repurpose a compute node for use as a UAN. However, compute nodes do not have the necessary network interface cards to support user access over the Customer Access Network (CAN). Additionally, the network configuration of Mountain Cabinets do not support the CAN network. Therefore, repurposing a compute node as a UAN requires the system to be configured to use the Customer High-Speed Network (CHN) and that the compute nodes have a CHN IP address in SLS.\nThe SLS Networks setting for the SystemDefaultRoute must be CHN The repurposed compute nodes must have CHN IP addresses in SLS uan_can_setup must be set to true in the uan-config-management repo Procedure Perform the following steps to repurpose a compute node for use as a UAN.\nLog in to the master node ncn-m001. All commands in this procedure are run from the master node.\nVerify the system is configured to use the CHN as the System Default Route. If the SystemDefaultRoute is not CHN, the compute nodes may not be repurposed as UAN.\nncn-m001# cray sls networks describe BICAN --format json | jq -r \u0026#39;.ExtraProperties.SystemDefaultRoute\u0026#39; Verify a CHN IP address exists in SLS for each repurposed compute node. Repeat the following command and replace \u0026lt;XNAME\u0026gt; with the xname of each repurposed compute node. The compute node must have a CHN IP address in SLS or it cannot be repurposed as a UAN. See Add Compute IP addresses to CHN SLS data section of the Cray System Management documentation for information on adding compute nodes to the CHN.\nncn-m001# cray sls networks describe CHN | q -r \u0026#39;.ExtraProperties.Subnets[] | select(.FullName == \u0026#34;CHN Bootstrap DHCP Subnet\u0026#34;) | .IPReservations[] | select(.Comment == \u0026#34;\u0026lt;XNAME\u0026gt;\u0026#34;)\u0026#39; Verify that uan_can_setup: true is set in the uan-config-management CFS repo. See Enabling the Customer Access Network (CAN) or the Customer High Speed Network (CHN) for more information.\nChange the role and sub-role in HSM of the compute node(s) being repurposed as UANs to Application and UAN, respectively. Repeat the following command and replace \u0026lt;XNAME\u0026gt; with the xname of each repurposed compute node.\nncn-m001# cray hsm state components role update --role Application --sub-role UAN \u0026lt;XNAME\u0026gt; Verify the role and sub-role in HSM of the repurposed compute node(s) has been changed to \u0026lsquo;Application and 'UAN, respectively. Repeat the following command and replace \u0026lt;XNAME\u0026gt; with the xname of each repurposed compute node.\nncn-m001# cray hsm state components describe \u0026lt;XNAME\u0026gt; Run the BOS session template used to boot the UAN nodes. See Boot UAN Nodes for more information on booting UAN nodes with BOS. Replace \u0026lt;UAN_SESSIONTEMPLATE\u0026gt; with the name of the BOS session template used to boot the UAN nodes and \u0026lt;XNAME\u0026gt; with the xname of the repurposed compute node.\nncn-m001# cray bos session create --template-uuid \u0026lt;UAN_SESSIONTEMPLATE\u0026gt; --operation reboot --limit \u0026lt;XNAME\u0026gt; Verification as a UAN Once the repurposed compute node is booted as a UAN, the following steps will verify it is configured as a UAN. These steps may vary dependent upon how the site has configured the UAN nodes.\nBasic UAN Configuration Checks Verify the repurposed compute node has finished the configuration phase. The output should \u0026ldquo;configured\u0026rdquo;.\nncn-m001# cray cfs components describe \u0026lt;XNAME\u0026gt; --format json | jq -r .configurationStatus Login to the repurposed compute node from the master node ncn-m001 as the root user.\nVerify that the hsn0 interface has the CHN IP address assigned to it in SLS.\nuan# ip a | grep hsn0 Verify the default route is via hsn0\nuan# ip r | grep default Verify that all site UAN filesystems are mounted.\nCommon UAN Configuration Checks If LDAP is used for user authentication, verify the LDAP service is reachable.\nuan# ping \u0026lt;ldap_service_ip\u0026gt; If SLURM is used, test sinfo and srun commands. This example srun command should return the hostname of 4 compute nodes.\nuan# sinfo uan# srun -N4 hostname Verify Users can Login Login to the repurposed compute node as an authorized non-root user from any host that should have UAN access.\nIf SLURM is used, test sinfo and srun commands.

This image is currently considered a \u0026ldquo;Technical Preview\u0026rdquo; as the initial support for booting with SLES Images without COS. This guide documents the procedure to boot and configure the new image as it currently differs from the standard COS-based image process in some ways.\nThe image is built with the same packer/qemu pipeline as Non-Compute-Node Images. Similarties may be noticed including the kernel and package versions.\nLimitations As this is currently a \u0026ldquo;Technical Preview\u0026rdquo; of supporting SLES Images on Application Nodes, there are several limitations:\nS3 presigned URLs with an expiration limit for the rootfs must be created.

CFS can apply configuration to both images and nodes. When the configuration is applied to nodes, the nodes must be booted and accessible through SSH over the Node Management Network (NMN).\nThe Ansible roles involved in UAN configuration are listed in the site.yml file in the uan-config-management git repository in VCS. Most of the roles that are specific to image configuration are required for the operation as a UAN and must not be removed from site.yml.\nThe UAN-specific roles involved in post-boot UAN node configuration are:\nuan_disk_config: this role configures the last disk found on the UAN that is smaller than 1TB, by default. That disk will be formatted with a scratch and swap partition mounted at /scratch and /swap, respectively. Each partition is 50% of the disk.\nuan_packages: this role installs any RPM packages listed in the uan-config-management repo.\nuan_interfaces: this role configures the UAN node networking. By default, this role does not configure a default route or the Customer Access Network (CAN or CHN) connection for the HPE Cray EX supercomputer. If CAN or CHN is enabled, the default route will be on the CAN or CHN. Otherwise, a default route must be set up in the customer interfaces definitions. Without the CAN or CHN, there will not be an external connection to the customer site network unless one is defined in the customer interfaces. See Configure Interfaces on UANs.\nNOTE: If a UAN layer is used in the Compute node CFS configuration, the uan_interfaces role will configure the default route on Compute nodes to be on the HSN, if the BICAN System Default Route is set to CHN.\nuan_motd: this role Provides a default message of the day that can be customized by the administrator.\nuan_ldap: this optional role configures the connection to LDAP servers. To disable this role, the administrator must set \u0026lsquo;uan_ldap_setup:no\u0026rsquo; in the \u0026lsquo;uan-config-management\u0026rsquo; VCS repository.\nThe UAN roles in site.yml are required and must not be removed, with exception of uan_ldap if the site is using some other method of user authentication. The uan_ldap may also be skipped by setting the value of uan_ldap_setup to no in a group_vars or host_vars configuration file.\nFor more information about these roles, see UAN Ansible Roles.\nUAN network configuration The uan_interfaces role configures the interfaces on the UAN nodes in three phases:\nSetup and configure the NMN. Gather information from the System Layout Service (SLS) for the NMN. Populate /etc/resolv.conf. Configure the first OCP port on an HPE server, or the first LOM port on a Gigabyte server, as the nmn0 interface. Set up the CAN or CHN, if wanted Gather information from SLS for the CAN or CHN. Configure the route to the CAN or CHN gateway as the default one. Implement the CAN or CHN. CAN: Implement bonded pair On HPE servers, use the second port of the 25Gb OCP card and a second 25Gb card. On Gigabyte servers, use both ports of the 40Gb card. CHN: Implement the CHN interface on the HSN Setup customer-defined networks See Configure Interfaces on UANs for detailed instructions.\nUAN LDAP network requirements LDAP configuration requires either a CAN or another customer-provided network that can route to the LDAP servers. Both such networks route outside of the HPE Cray EX system. If a UAN only has the nmn0 interface configured and active, the UAN cannot route outside of the system.\n"

In the UAN 2.3 release, UAN does not install a recipe, and a COS recipe must be used. Additional uan packages will now be installed via CFS and the uan_packages role.\nPerform the following before starting this procedure:\nInstall the COS, Slingshot, and UAN product streams. Initialize the cray administrative CLI. In the COS recipe for 2.2, several dependencies have been removed, this includes Slingshot, DVS, and Lustre. Those packages are now installed during CFS Image Customization. More information on this change is covered in the Create UAN Boot Images procedure.\nIdentify the COS image recipe to base the UAN image on.

For details on the variables referred to in this procedure, see UAN Ansible Roles.\nIn the command examples of this procedure, PRODUCT_VERSION refers to the current installed version of the UAN product. Replace PRODUCT_VERSION with the UAN version number string when executing the commands.\nNode Management Networking By default, the Node Management Network (NMN) is connected to a single nmn0 interface. If desired, and the system networking is configured to support it, the Node Management Network may be configured as a bonded interface, nmnb0. To configure the NMN as a bonded pair, set uan_nmn_bond to true and set the interfaces to be used in the bond in uan_nmn_bond_slaves as described in UAN Ansible Roles.\nUser Access Networking User access may be configured to use either a direct connection to the UANs from the site\u0026rsquo;s user network, or one of two optional user access networks implemented within the HPE Cray EX system. The two optional networks are the Customer Access Network (CAN) and Customer High Speed Network (CHN). The CAN is a VLAN on the Node Management Network (NMN), whereas the CHN is over the High Speed Network (HSN).\nBy default, a direct connection to the site\u0026rsquo;s user network is assumed and the Admin must define the interface(s) and default route using the customer_uan_interfaces and customer_uan_routes structures. If uan_can_setup is a true value, user access will be over CAN or CHN depending on what the system default route is set to in SLS.\nWhen CAN is set as the system default route in SLS and uan_nmn_bond is false, the bonded CAN interfaces are determined automatically. If uan_nmn_bond is true, the bonded CAN interfaces must be defined by uan_can_bond_slaves (see UAN Ansible Roles). The default route is set to the bonded CAN interface can0.\nWhen CHN is set as the system default route in SLS, the CHN IP is added to hsn0 and the default route is set to the CHN.\nThe Admin may override the CAN/CHN default route by setting uan_customer_default_route to true and defining the default route in customer_uan_routes.\nProcedure Network configuration settings are defined in the uan-config-management VCS repo under the group_vars/ROLE_SUBROLE/ or host_vars/XNAME/ directories, where ROLE_SUBROLE must be replaced by the role and subrole assigned for the node in HSM, and XNAME with the xname of the node. Values under group_vars/ROLE_SUBROLE/ apply to all nodes with the given role and subrole. Values under the host_vars/XNAME/ apply to the specific node with the xname and will override any values set in group_vars/ROLE_SUBROLE/. A yaml file is used by the Configuration Framwork Service (CFS). The examples in this procedure use customer_net.yml, but any filename may be used. Admins must create this yaml file and use the variables described in this procedure.\nIf the HPE Cray EX CAN or CHN is desired, set the uan_can_setup variable to yes in the yaml file. The UAN will be configured to use the CAN or CHN based on what the BICAN System Default Route is set to in SLS.\nObtain the password for the crayvcs user.\nncn-m001# kubectl get secret -n services vcs-user-credentials \\ --template={{.data.vcs_password}} | base64 --decode Log in to ncn-w001.\nCreate a copy of the Git configuration.

The format is cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION. In this guide, an integration-PRODUCT_VERSION branch is used for examples to comply with IUF defaults, but the name can be any valid git branch name configured to be used by IUF.\nModifying the cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION branch that was created by the UAN product installation is not allowed by default.\nncn-m001# git checkout -b integration-PRODUCT_VERSION \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git merge cray/uan/PRODUCT_VERSION Switched to a new branch \u0026#39;integration-PRODUCT_VERSION\u0026#39; Already up to date. Apply any site-specific customizations and modifications to the Ansible configuration for the UAN nodes and commit the changes.\nThe default Ansible play to configure UAN nodes is site.yml in the base of the uan-config-management repository. The roles that are executed in this play allow for custom configuration as required for the system.\nConsult the individual Ansible role README.md files in the uan-config-management repository roles directory to configure individual role variables. Roles prefixed with uan_ are specific to UAN configuration and include network interfaces, disk, LDAP, software packages, and message of the day roles.\nNOTE: Admins must ensure the uan_can_setup variable is set to the correct value for the site. This variable controls how the nodes are configured for user access. When uan_can_setup is yes, user access is over the CAN or CHN, based on the BICAN System Default Route setting in SLS. When uan_can_setup is no, the Admin must configure the user access interface and default route. See Configure Interfaces on UANs\nWarning: Never place sensitive information such as passwords in the git repository.\nThe following example shows how to add a vars.yml file containing site-specific configuration values to the Application_UAN group variable location.\nThese and other Ansible files do not necessarily need to be modified for UAN image creation.

The configuration parameters have been stored in a branch in the UAN git repository. The next phase of the process uses sat bootprep to handle creating the CFS configurations, IMS images, and BOS sessiontemplates for UANs.\nCREATE UAN IMAGES\nWith Shasta Admin Toolkit (SAT) version 2.2.16 and later, it is recommended that administrators create an input file for use with sat bootprep. Use the following command to determine which version of SAT is installed:\nncn-m001# sat showrev --products --filter \u0026#39;product_name=\u0026#34;sat\u0026#34;\u0026#39; A sat bootprep input file will have three sections: configurations, images, and session_templates. These sections create CFS configurations, IMS images, and BOS session templates respectively. Each section may have multiple elements to create more than one CFS, IMS, or BOS artifact. The format is similar to the input files for CFS, IMS, and BOS, but SAT will automate the process with fewer steps. Follow the subsections below to create a UAN bootprep input file.\nRefer to HPE Cray EX System Software Getting Started Guide for further information on configuring other HPE products, as this procedure documents only the required configuration of the UAN.\nSAT Bootprep Configuration\nThe SAT bootprep input file should have a configuration section that specifies each layer to be included in the CFS configuration for the UAN images for image customization and node personalization. This section will result in a CFS configuration named uan-config. The versions of each layer may be gathered using sat showrev.\nNote that the Slingshot Host Software CFS layer is listed first. This is required as the UAN layer will attempt to install DVS and Lustre packages that require SHS be installed first. The correct playbook for Cassini or Mellanox must also be specified. Consult the Slingshot Host Software documentation for more information.\nBeginning with UAN version 2.6.0, CFS configuration roles which are provided by COS are now defined as two separate COS configuration layers as shown in the example below. Prior to UAN version 2.6.0, these roles were included in the UAN configuration layer. Separating these roles into COS layers allows COS updates to be independent from UAN updates.\nconfigurations: - name: uan-config layers: - name: shs-mellanox_install-integration playbook: shs_mellanox_install.yml product: name: slingshot-host-software version: 2.0.0 branch: integration # - name: shs-cassini_install-integration # playbook: shs_cassini_install.yml # product: # name: slingshot-host-software # version: 2.0.0 # branch: integration - name: cos-application-integration playbook: cos-application.yml product: name: cos version: 2.5 - name: csm-packages-integration playbook: csm_packages.yml product: name: csm version: 1.4 - name: uan playbook: site.yml product: name: uan version: 2.6.0 branch: integration-PRODUCT_VERSION ... add configuration layers for other products here, if desired ... - name: uan-rebuild-initrd playbook: rebuild-initrd.yml product: name: uan version: 2.6.0 branch: integration-PRODUCT_VERSION SAT Bootprep Image\nThe SAT bootprep input file should have a section that specifies which IMS images to create for UAN nodes. UANs are built using the COS recipe, so the section below specifies which image recipe to use based on what is provided by COS. To determine which COS recipes are available run the following command:\nncn-m001# sat showrev --products --filter \u0026#39;product_name=\u0026#34;cos\u0026#34;\u0026#39; This example will create an IMS image with the name cray-shasta-uan-sles15sp3.x86_64-2.3.25. An appropriate name should be used to correctly identify the UAN image being built. Also note that the CFS configuration uan-config is being referenced so that CFS image customization will be run using that configuration along with the specified node groups.\nimages: - name: cray-shasta-uan-sles15sp3.x86_64-2.3.25 ims: is_recipe: true name: cray-shasta-compute-sles15sp3.x86_64-2.3.25 configuration: uan-config configuration_group_names: - Application - Application_UAN SAT Bootprep Session Template\nThe final section of the SAT bootprep input file creates BOS session templates. This section references the named IMS image that sat bootprep generates, as well as a CFS configuration. The boot_sets key \u0026ldquo;uan\u0026rdquo; may be changed as needed. If there are more than one boot_sets in the session template, each key will need to be unique.\nsession_templates: - name: uan-2.4.0 image: cray-shasta-uan-sles15sp3.x86_64-2.3.25 configuration: uan-config bos_parameters: boot_sets: uan: kernel_parameters: spire_join_token=${SPIRE_JOIN_TOKEN} node_roles_groups: - Application_UAN Run SAT Bootprep\nInitiate the sat bootprep command to generate the configurations and artifacts needed to boot UANs. This command may take some time as it will initiate IMS image creation and CFS image customization.\nncn-m001# sat bootprep run uan-bootprep.yaml If changes are necessary to complete sat bootprep with the provided input file, make adjustments to the CFS layers or input file as needed and rerun the sat bootprep command. If any artifacts are going to be overwritten, SAT will prompt for confirmation before taking action. This is useful when making CFS changes as SAT will automatically configure the layers to use the latest git commits if the branches are specified correctly.\nOnce sat bootprep completes successfully, save the input file to a known location. This input file will be useful to regenerate artifacts as changes are made or different product layers are added.\nFinally, perform Boot UANs to boot the UANs with the new BOS session template.\n"

To reach the vulnerability kernel configuration flag CONFIG_TLS or CONFIG_XFRM_ESPINTCP has to be configured, but the operation does not require any privilege. There is a use-after-free bug of icsk_ulp_data of a struct inet_connection_sock. When CONFIG_TLS is enabled, user can install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket. The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the context is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading past commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c\nCVE-2023-0461\nCurrent status from SUSE: https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-0461.html\nMitigation While the underlying CVE is being addressed by SUSE, UANs can mitigate this issue by unbonding the CAN (if it is being used), and unloading the TLS kernel module after blocking the kernel from being loaded again.\nThe mitigation script provided below will perform the following actions:\nSelect the first BONDING_SLAVE0 from ifcfg-bond0 if it exists Replace bond0 in ifcfg-can0 with the BONDING_SLAVE0 interface Reload interfaces Add a blacklist for the tls module Unload bonding and tls kernel modules provided mlx5_core is not present Fail if mlx5_core is detected to highlight that the mititagtion failed Important: This mitigation is intend for UANs that meet the following criteria:\nThe UANs are connected to HPE Aruba Networking switches (lcap-individual must be set for other switch types to allow for unbonded CAN connections) The UANs use HPE Slingshot HSN NICs and not Mellanox ConnectX-5 HSN NICs.

BOS uses session templates to define various parameters such as:\nWhich nodes to boot Which image to boot Kernel parameters Whether to perform post-boot configuration (Node Personalization) of the nodes by CFS. Which CFS configuration to use if Node Personalization is enabled. UAN boots are performed in three phases:\nPXE booting an iPXE binary that will load the initrd of the UAN image that will boot. Booting the initrd (dracut) image which configures the UAN for booting the UAN image. This process consists of two phases. Configuring the UAN node to use the Content Projection Service (CPS) and Data Virtualization Service (DVS). These services manage the UAN image rootfs mounting and make that image available to the UAN nodes. Mounting the rootfs Booting the UAN image rootfs. PXE Issues Most PXE boot failures are the result of misconfigured network switches and/or BIOS settings. The UAN must PXE boot over the Node Management Network (NMN) and the switches must be configured to allow connectivity to the NMN. The cable for the NMN must be connected to the first port of the OCP card on HPE DL325 and DL385 servers or to the first port of the built-in LAN-On-Motherboard (LOM) on Gigabyte servers. See \u0026ldquo;Prepare for UAN Product Installation\u0026rdquo; in the UAN Installation Guide for details on the switch and BIOS settings required to configure the UAN for PXE booting.\nUANs may fail to boot when the BIOS EFITIME is too far away from the time on management nodes. If there are x509 certificate problems, check that the BIOS time is correct. See \u0026ldquo;Configure the BIOS of an HPE UAN\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Configure the BIOS of a Gigabyte UAN\u0026rdquo; in the UAN Installation Guide for examples of checking settings in the BIOS.\nInitrd (Dracut) Issues Dracut failures are often caused by the wrong interface being named nmn0, or to multiple entries for the UAN xname in DNS. The latter is a result of multiple interfaces making DHCP requests. Either condition can cause IP address mismatches in the dvs_node_map. DNS configures entries based on DHCP leases.\nWhen dracut starts, it renames the network device named by the ifmap=netX:nmn0 kernel parameter to nmn0. This interface is the only one dracut will enable DHCP on. The ip=nmn0:dhcp kernel parameter limits dracut to DHCP only nmn0. The ifmap value must be set correctly in the kernel_parameters field of the BOS session template.\nSee Create UAN Boot Images for details on how to configure the BOS session template. For UAN nodes that have more than one PCI card installed, ifmap=net2:nmn0 is the correct setting. If only one PCI card is installed, ifmap=net0:nmn0 is normally the correct setting.\nUANs require CPS and DVS to boot from images. These services are configured in dracut to retrieve the rootfs and mount it. If the image fails to download, check that DVS and CPS are both healthy, and DVS is running on all worker nodes. Run the following commands to check DVS and CPS:\nncn-m001# kubectl get nodes -l cps-pm-node=True -o custom-columns=\u0026#34;:metadata.name\u0026#34; --no-headers ncn-w001 ncn-w002 ncn-m001# for node in `kubectl get nodes -l cps-pm-node=True -o custom-columns=\u0026#34;:metadata.name\u0026#34; \\ --no-headers`; do ssh $node \u0026#34;lsmod | grep \u0026#39;^dvs \u0026#39;\u0026#34; done ncn-w001 ncn-w002 If DVS and CPS are both healthy, then both of these commands will return all the worker NCNs in the HPE Cray EX system.\nImage Boot Issues Once dracut exits, the UAN will boot the rootfs image. Failures seen in this phase tend to be failures of spire-agent, cfs-state-reporter, or both. The cfs-state-reporter tells BOA that the node is ready and allows BOA to start CFS for Node Personalization. If cfs-state-reporter does not start, check if the spire-agent has started. The cfs-state-reporter depends on the spire-agent. Running systemctl status spire-agent will show that that service is enabled and running if there are no issues with that service. Similarly, running systemctl status cfs-state-reporter will show a status of SUCCESS.\nuan# systemctl status spire-agent ● spire-agent.service - SPIRE Agent Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/spire-agent.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: active (running) since Wed 2021-02-24 14:27:33 CST; 19h ago Main PID: 3581 (spire-agent) Tasks: 57 CGroup: /system.slice/spire-agent.service └─3581 /usr/bin/spire-agent run -expandEnv -config /root/spire/conf/spire-agent.conf uan# systemctl status cfs-state-reporter ● cfs-state-reporter.service - cfs-state-reporter reports configuration level of the system Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/cfs-state-reporter.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled) Active: inactive (dead) since Wed 2021-02-24 14:29:51 CST; 19h ago Main PID: 3827 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) There may be errors related to failing to load kernel modules during the boot:\nFAILED Failed to start Load Kernel Modules.

UAN disk configuration will fail if the disk on the node is already partitioned. Manually erase any existing partitions to fix the issue.\nThis procedure currently only addresses uan_disk_config errors due to existing disk partitions.\nRefer to About UAN Configuration for an explanation of UAN disk configuration.\nThe most common cause of failure in the uan_disk_config role is the disk having been previously configured without a /scratch and /swap partition.
